            <p class = "bio"> Overall, I have contributed much to my community over the years. 
                I started in highschool with key club and the many different NHS clubs I was apart of. 
                Whether it was teaching  elementary students about different science concepts or volunteering at local marathons, 
                I have always been a good member of my community.

                <br>
                Since I started my time here at TAMU I have not been able to commit as much of my time to volunteering as I would have liked over these
                past few years but I am gradually getting back into it. This semester I hope to start participating in my club's out reach program. The club
                that I am an officer in, TidalTAMU, currently is focusing on a project called TidalTAMU jr. which focuses on teaching highschool and younger students
                valuable skills in computer programming and aims to better prepare any students interested in a degree or career in computer science.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I have not been able to particpate yet due to my class schedule, I hope to be able to travel to nearby schools to teach more about 
                programming and the unlimited applicaitons of it!
