            <p class = "bio">Howdy! My name is Aaron Barbosa and I am currently a junior <a href= "https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">Computer Engineering </a>  
                student here at Texas A&M. I was born in Fairfax, Virginia and from there lived abroad in Milan, Italy before I moved
                back to the US and settled down in Cypress, Texas. From there I attended <a href = "https://www.cfisd.net/CyRanch" target = "_blank">Cypress Ranch Highschool</a> and graduated with 
                honors before attending Texas A&M in 2019. Overall, I would like to think that I am a fairly hardworking and happy-go-lucky person with a strong desire to improve myself in any way possible. In my free time, I enjoy biking around campus and back home with a side of film photography. I find not knowing the results 
                of a shoot more exciting for when I get back my developed film. My cat Koko is the best and keeps me in high spirits whenever I am feeling stressed out or am burnt out from studying all day.

                <br>
                <br> From there I've enjoyed my time here at A&M by attending my classes, joining a few clubs, and meeting all kinds of new people.
                I've been lucky enough to join an incredible research team here under the department of material science and engineering where I work with 
                incredibly smart and talented people to solve real-world problems. You can learn more about my research <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Rn1uI33Jc&ab_channel=O-REUfinalprojectpresentations"> here!</a>

                <br>
                <br> I am currently an officer for a club here at TAMU called "TidalTAMU". Tidal is essentially a research-based machine learning and computer science
                club that accepts students of all majors to help them learn more about what machine learning and programming can do to solve real-world problems. If any of that 
                sounds interesting to you, you can find out more information about the club and their projects <a href = "https://www.tidalwaive.com/tamu/">here</a> and you can talk to all the other officers on discord <a href="https://tinyurl.com/tidaltamudiscord"> here.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Feel free to reach out to me if any of this has interested you and you would like to speak more about my professional background or more about my personal information.
