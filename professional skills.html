                Howdy! This page will provide you with all the information you could want on my technical skills and areas of interst professionally. 
                Overall, I have extensive experience with presentations due to my past work with research, I have good knowlege of quite a few different 
                programming languages due to my coursework, and I am always doing my best to help this list grow so that I can become the best 
                version of myself that I can.

                In general, computer sceince has not been the topic I have been most interested in. I really enjoy circuits and computer engineering as a whole which 
                is why I decided to pursure a degree in computer engineering here at TAMU. Computer programming skills come with the major as many of my 
                core classes before I started taking my more computer engineering focused ones were purly computer science programming course with a little 
                focus on applications of programming for computer engineering.
